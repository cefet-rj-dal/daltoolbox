# Regression Examples

Supervised regression algorithms and tuning.

- [reg_dtree.md](/examples/regression/reg_dtree.md) — `reg_dtree`: decision tree for regression. Partitions feature space and estimates values by leaf means; interpretable and can model nonlinearities.
- [reg_knn.md](/examples/regression/reg_knn.md) — `reg_knn`: k-Nearest Neighbors for regression. Predicts the mean (or weighted mean) of targets from the k nearest neighbors.
- [reg_mlp.md](/examples/regression/reg_mlp.md) — `reg_mlp`: Multilayer Perceptron (neural network) for regression.
- [reg_rf.md](/examples/regression/reg_rf.md) — `reg_rf`: Random Forest for regression. Averages many decision trees trained with randomness; tends to reduce variance.
- [reg_svm.md](/examples/regression/reg_svm.md) — `reg_svm`: Support Vector Regression (SVR). Models a function with an error-insensitive margin up to `epsilon` and penalizes violations via `cost`.
- [reg_tune.md](/examples/regression/reg_tune.md) — `reg_tune`: hyperparameter search for regression models over ranges in `ranges`.
