As research experiments grow in scale and complexity, data analytics
demands tools that go beyond isolated functions. DAL Toolbox is a
framework designed to meet these modern challenges by organizing a
comprehensive set of data analytics capabilities into an integrated
workflow environment. Inspired by the Experiment Line model
<doi:10.1007/978-3-642-02279-1_20>, it supports essential tasks such as
data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, and time
series prediction. With a unified data model, consistent method API, and
support for hyperparameter tuning, DAL Toolbox enables the seamless
construction and execution of end-to-end analytics pipelines. It also
offers easy integration with existing libraries and languages, promoting
usability, extensibility, and reproducibility in data science.
