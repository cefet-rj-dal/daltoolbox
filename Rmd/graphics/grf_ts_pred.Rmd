- Time series with fit and forecast: shows observed values, model fit, and forecast horizon for visual comparison.

Graphics environment setup.

Synthetic series with noise; split windows for fit and forecast.
```{r}
# Synthetic time series

x <- base::seq(0, 10, 0.25)
yvalues <- sin(x) + rnorm(41,0,0.1)
```

```{r}

# prediction
adjust <- sin(x[1:35])
prediction <- sin(x[36:41])
```

Plot time series with fit and forecast.
```{r}
# Time series with forecast

# Chart with observed values, model fit, and predicted values. 

plot_ts_pred(y=yvalues, yadj=adjust, ypre=prediction)
