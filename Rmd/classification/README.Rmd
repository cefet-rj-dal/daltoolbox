# Classification Examples

Supervised classification algorithms and tuning.

- [cla_dtree.Rmd](cla_dtree.Rmd) — `cla_dtree`: Decision Tree for classification. Recursively splits on explanatory variables to separate classes, yielding an interpretable model.
- [cla_knn.Rmd](cla_knn.Rmd) — `cla_knn`: k-Nearest Neighbors classifier. Classifies by majority vote among the k nearest neighbors in feature space.
- [cla_majority.Rmd](cla_majority.Rmd) — `cla_majority`: baseline classifier that always predicts the most frequent class observed during training. Useful as a minimum performance reference.
- [cla_mlp.Rmd](cla_mlp.Rmd) — `cla_mlp`: Multilayer Perceptron (feedforward neural network) for classification.
- [cla_nb.Rmd](cla_nb.Rmd) — `cla_nb`: Naive Bayes for classification. Probabilistic model assuming conditional independence among features; simple, efficient, and often competitive.
- [cla_rf.Rmd](cla_rf.Rmd) — `cla_rf`: Random Forest for classification. Ensemble of decision trees trained with randomness; robust and handles heterogeneous features well.
- [cla_svm.Rmd](cla_svm.Rmd) — `cla_svm`: Support Vector Machine for classification, maximizing the margin between classes.
- [cla_tune.Rmd](cla_tune.Rmd) — `cla_tune`: performs hyperparameter search for a classifier over ranges defined in `ranges`.
