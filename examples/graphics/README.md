# Graphics Examples

Chart examples with ggplot2 and helpers.

- [grf_bar_error.md](grf_bar_error.md) — Bars with error bars: add uncertainty/variability (e.g., standard deviation) to bars using `geom_errorbar()`.
- [grf_bar.md](grf_bar.md) — Bar: compares aggregated values by categories. Useful for means, counts, and totals by group.
- [grf_boxplot.md](grf_boxplot.md) — Boxplot: summarizes distribution via quartiles and highlights outliers; comparable across groups.
- [grf_density.md](grf_density.md) — Density (kernel density): smoothed version of the histogram for continuous variables; highlights distribution shapes.
- [grf_grouped_bar.md](grf_grouped_bar.md) — Grouped bars: compares multiple measures per category, displaying side-by-side bars.
- [grf_histogram.md](grf_histogram.md) — Histogram: distributes observations into bins along the x-axis; useful to visualize frequency and skewness.
- [grf_lollipop.md](grf_lollipop.md) — Lollipop: alternative to bars, emphasizes values with a marker and a stem; lighter visual for comparisons.
- [grf_pie.md](grf_pie.md) — Pie: represents proportions of a total. Use sparingly and with few categories when angles are easy to compare.
- [grf_points.md](grf_points.md) — Points: similar to series, but without connecting lines; good to highlight discrete observations.
- [grf_radar.md](grf_radar.md) — Radar: displays multiple numeric variables on radial axes from a common origin; useful for comparative profiles.
- [grf_save_jpg.md](grf_save_jpg.md) — Chart saving: example of exporting with `jpeg()`/`dev.off()` and `ggsave()` to image files.
- [grf_save_pdf.md](grf_save_pdf.md) — Chart saving: example of exporting with `ggsave()` to PDF, controlling dimensions and units.
- [grf_scatter.md](grf_scatter.md) — Scatter: assesses the relationship between two numeric variables, with optional coloring by group/category.
- [grf_series.md](grf_series.md) — Time series (lines): points connected by segments; highlights trend and seasonality over time/ordered axis.
- [grf_stacked_bar.md](grf_stacked_bar.md) — Stacked bars: shows each category's composition by summing groups; useful for cumulative proportions.
- [grf_ts_pred.md](grf_ts_pred.md) — Time series with fit and forecast: shows observed values, model fit, and forecast horizon for visual comparison.
- [grf_ts.md](grf_ts.md) — Simple time series: exploratory visualization of a temporal vector with ordered x-axis and y values.
